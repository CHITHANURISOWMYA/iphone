<p> Hyderabad is 1,566 km (973 mi) south of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi">Delhi </a>, 699 km (434 mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 570 km (350 mi) north of Bangalore by road.It is situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India,along the banks of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musi_River_(India) " > Musi River </a>, a tributary of Krishna River located on the Deccan Plateau in the northern part of South India.Greater Hyderabad covers 650 km2 (250 sq mi), making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in India.With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), Hyderabad lies on predominantly sloping terrain of grey and pink granite, dotted with small hills, the highest being Banjara Hills at 672 m (2,205 ft).The city has numerous lakes sometime referred to as sagar, meaning "sea".

<h3>CULTURE</h3>
<P> Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become note: A further consequence of this north-south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana.The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.

    Traditional Hyderabadi garb reveals a mix of Muslim and Hindu influences with men wearing sherwani and kurtapaijama and women wearing khara dupatta and salwar kameez. Most Muslim women wear burqa and hijab outdoors.In addition to the traditional Hindu and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths
